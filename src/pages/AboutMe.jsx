      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, I'm Donovan, a Web Developer based in San Antonio, Texas. With a strong passion for technology, design, and problem-solving, I specialize in bringing ideas to life through coding and design.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey in Web Development started with editing MySpace pages, and I've been hooked ever since. I stay current with the latest technologies and techniques to navigate the ever-evolving digital landscape.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding or designing, you can find me at the gym, socializing with friends, or playing guitar. I approach challenges with optimism and a belief in the power to overcome obstacles. I'm excited to collaborate with fellow creators and take on new projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you're here to explore my portfolio or discuss potential projects, I'm eager to connect and share my skills and experiences. Let's work together to bring your ideas to life.
